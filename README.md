archive your weibo to an email address

This is a very primitive tool which send all your weibo text to an email address specified. 

This code was written in around 2013 so it is using a very old version of SAE APIs. It does not supposed to be able to run on current SAE environments.

I am also a novice of PHP, just learned it from sina weibo examples.
